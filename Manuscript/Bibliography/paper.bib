	abstract = {Data science is a highly interdisciplinary field that comprises various principles, methodologies, and guidelines for the analysis of data. The creation of appropriate curricula that use computational tools and teaching activities is necessary for building skills and knowledge in data science. However, much of the literature about data science curricula focuses on the undergraduate university level. In this study, we developed an introductory data science curriculum for an out of school enrichment program aimed at middle grade learners (ages 11–13). We observed how the participants in the program (n = 11) learned data science practices through the combination of nonprogramming activities and programming activities using the language R. The results revealed that participants in the program were able to investigate statistical questions of their creation, perform data analysis using statistics and the creation of data visuals, make meaning from their results, and communicate their findings. These results suggest that a series of learner-centered nonprogramming and programming activities using R can facilitate the learning of data science skills for middle-school age students.},

	abstract = {Researchers' efforts to build a knowledge base of how middle school students learn about machine learning (ML) is limited, particularly, considering the African context. Hence, we conducted an experimental classroom study (N = 32) within the context of extracurricular activities in a Nigerian middle school to discern how students engaged with ML activities. Furthermore, we explored whether participation in our intervention program elicit changes in students' ML comprehension, and perceptions. Using multiple qualitative data collection techniques including interviews, pre-post open-ended surveys and written assessments, we uncover evidence that indicated evolution of students’ ML understanding, ethical awareness, and societal implication of ML. In addition, our findings showed that a middle school student can learn and understand ML, even when one had no prior knowledge or interest in science related careers. The findings have implication for pedagogical design of AI instruction in middle school context. We discuss the implication of our results for researchers and relevant stakeholders, highlight the limitations and chart future work paths.},

	abstract = {There is growing interest in how to better prepare K–12 students to work with data. In this article, we assert that these discussions of teaching and learning must attend to the human dimensions of data work. Specifically, we draw from several established lines of research to argue that practices involving the creation and manipulation of data are shaped by a combination of personal experiences, cultural tools and practices, and political concerns. We demonstrate through two examples how our proposed humanistic stance highlights ways that efforts to make data personally relevant for youth also necessarily implicate cultural and sociopolitical dimensions that affect the design and learning opportunities in data-rich learning environments. We offer an interdisciplinary framework based on literature from multiple bodies of educational research to inform design, teaching and research for more effective, responsible, and inclusive student learning experiences with and about data.},

	abstract = {In this article, we consider how to make data more meaningful to students through the choice of data and the activities we use them in drawing upon students lived experiences more in the teaching of statistics and data science courses. In translating scholarship around culturally relevant pedagogy from the fields of education and mathematics education we develop the idea of culturally relevant data. We see this development as a key ingredient to implementing culturally relevant pedagogy in teaching data-intensive courses leveraging the centrality of context through data in both statistics and data science to engage students particularly from historically marginalized groups in STEM. We provide suggestions as to ways of finding or creating culturally relevant data and using them in implementing culturally relevant pedagogy to support the learning and flourishing of students in statistics and data science courses. We also present findings from pilot work we have done in implementing these data in statistics courses. Finally, we discuss lingering questions and possible next steps for research in this area.

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence integrates with our daily life in more ways each day with the invention of new tools and applications. For example, businesses utilize machine learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence, to identify the ideal customer for targeted advertisement. Machine learning and data science scale previous manual problems to a wider customer base. With all the various applications for artificial intelligence, there is still a noticeable gap in the number of qualified job applicants who can solve some of the machine learning problems of the day. There is a movement to introduce computer science education earlier to K-12 students. One motivation behind an earlier introduction is to better prepare students to study computer science at universities and fulfill these coveted technology positions in the future. Given this motivation, there needs to be more computer science instructional activities and lesson plans to support K-12 teachers. Currently there are several new tools and curricula available for computer science. However, there is a need for beginner and K-12 accessible data science and machine learning instructional methods. These topics are advanced computer science electives but an earlier introduction can still benefit students. Interactive visual activities support high school students to learn challenging topics. In this paper, we consider how a visual analytic process can present difficult data science concepts. We present an interactive visual educational tool to teach data science to high school students. The first activity introduces the visual analytic pipeline. The next interactive activities present machine learning classification and regression topics. We select datasets and applications which are relatable to our main audience. This paper describes the design and implementation of the data science educational tool for high school students.},
