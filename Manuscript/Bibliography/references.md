- abstract: Data science is a highly interdisciplinary field that
    comprises various principles, methodologies, and guidelines for the
    analysis of data. The creation of appropriate curricula that use
    computational tools and teaching activities is necessary for
    building skills and knowledge in data science. However, much of the
    literature about data science curricula focuses on the undergraduate
    university level. In this study, we developed an introductory data
    science curriculum for an out of school enrichment program aimed at
    middle grade learners (ages 11--13). We observed how the
    participants in the program (n = 11) learned data science practices
    through the combination of nonprogramming activities and programming
    activities using the language R. The results revealed that
    participants in the program were able to investigate statistical
    questions of their creation, perform data analysis using statistics
    and the creation of data visuals, make meaning from their results,
    and communicate their findings. These results suggest that a series
    of learner-centered nonprogramming and programming activities using
    R can facilitate the learning of data science skills for
    middle-school age students.

- abstract: Researchers' efforts to build a knowledge base of how middle
    school students learn about machine learning (ML) is limited,
    particularly, considering the African context. Hence, we conducted
    an experimental classroom study (N = 32) within the context of
    extracurricular activities in a Nigerian middle school to discern
    how students engaged with ML activities. Furthermore, we explored
    whether participation in our intervention program elicit changes in
    students' ML comprehension, and perceptions. Using multiple
    qualitative data collection techniques including interviews,
    pre-post open-ended surveys and written assessments, we uncover
    evidence that indicated evolution of students' ML understanding,
    ethical awareness, and societal implication of ML. In addition, our
    findings showed that a middle school student can learn and
    understand ML, even when one had no prior knowledge or interest in
    science related careers. The findings have implication for
    pedagogical design of AI instruction in middle school context. We
    discuss the implication of our results for researchers and relevant
    stakeholders, highlight the limitations and chart future work paths.

- abstract: There is growing interest in how to better prepare K--12
    students to work with data. In this article, we assert that these
    discussions of teaching and learning must attend to the human
    dimensions of data work. Specifically, we draw from several
    established lines of research to argue that practices involving the
    creation and manipulation of data are shaped by a combination of
    personal experiences, cultural tools and practices, and political
    concerns. We demonstrate through two examples how our proposed
    humanistic stance highlights ways that efforts to make data
    personally relevant for youth also necessarily implicate cultural
    and sociopolitical dimensions that affect the design and learning
    opportunities in data-rich learning environments. We offer an
    interdisciplinary framework based on literature from multiple bodies
    of educational research to inform design, teaching and research for
    more effective, responsible, and inclusive student learning
    experiences with and about data.

- abstract: In this article, we consider how to make data more
    meaningful to students through the choice of data and the activities
    we use them in drawing upon students lived experiences more in the
    teaching of statistics and data science courses. In translating
    scholarship around culturally relevant pedagogy from the fields of
    education and mathematics education we develop the idea of
    culturally relevant data. We see this development as a key
    ingredient to implementing culturally relevant pedagogy in teaching
    data-intensive courses leveraging the centrality of context through
    data in both statistics and data science to engage students
    particularly from historically marginalized groups in STEM. We
    provide suggestions as to ways of finding or creating culturally
    relevant data and using them in implementing culturally relevant
    pedagogy to support the learning and flourishing of students in
    statistics and data science courses. We also present findings from
    pilot work we have done in implementing these data in statistics
    courses. Finally, we discuss lingering questions and possible next
    steps for research in this area. Supplementary materials for this
    article are available online.

- abstract: Artificial intelligence integrates with our daily life in
    more ways each day with the invention of new tools and applications.
    For example, businesses utilize machine learning, which is a
    subfield of artificial intelligence, to identify the ideal customer
    for targeted advertisement. Machine learning and data science scale
    previous manual problems to a wider customer base. With all the
    various applications for artificial intelligence, there is still a
    noticeable gap in the number of qualified job applicants who can
    solve some of the machine learning problems of the day. There is a
    movement to introduce computer science education earlier to K-12
    students. One motivation behind an earlier introduction is to better
    prepare students to study computer science at universities and
    fulfill these coveted technology positions in the future. Given this
    motivation, there needs to be more computer science instructional
    activities and lesson plans to support K-12 teachers. Currently
    there are several new tools and curricula available for computer
    science. However, there is a need for beginner and K-12 accessible
    data science and machine learning instructional methods. These
    topics are advanced computer science electives but an earlier
    introduction can still benefit students. Interactive visual
    activities support high school students to learn challenging topics.
    In this paper, we consider how a visual analytic process can present
    difficult data science concepts. We present an interactive visual
    educational tool to teach data science to high school students. The
    first activity introduces the visual analytic pipeline. The next
    interactive activities present machine learning classification and
    regression topics. We select datasets and applications which are
    relatable to our main audience. This paper describes the design and
    implementation of the data science educational tool for high school
    students.
