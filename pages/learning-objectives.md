# Learning objectives outline

This document serves to show the learning objectives of all topics this websites pages.

Introduction
By the end of this lesson, students will know:
Reasons why statistics is helpful in the real world for identifying differences and patterns
Challenges of trying to determine differences and patterns
A comparison model of genetic diversity (dogs) to reference when thinking through the following lessons

Genetic diversity
By the end of this lesson, students will know:
What genes and DNA are
How to define genetic diversity, genetic variation, and gene expression
How genetic diversity applies to Fast Plants

Averages and medians (measures of centrality)
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to calculate the mean and median
Explain why the mean and median is useful when critically thinking about data
Explain how the median and mean can be skewed 

Variance and distributions
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to
Explain how the mean is helpful but is aided by variance to critically think about data
Explain what standard deviation is for a sample
Understand what distributions are and why the normal distribution is used frequently

Probability and z-score
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to understand
the basics of events happening in terms of probability
How z-scores of a individual data point explain how common that data point is
How z-scores interact with distributions and we get p-values from it

Hypothesis testing
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to understand
What a hypothesis is
What is a null and alternative hypothesis
How it’s impossible to know everything about all variables in space and time, so we reject the null hypothesis
when to reject the null hypothesis based on p-values

Comparing 2 groups (t-tests)
Students will understand 
the value of testing two groups statistically
Understand when and how to apply t-tests
How to interpret a t-test
Test results
Test statistic
How to reject the null hypothesis

Comparing 2+ groups (ANOVA)
Students will understand 
the value of testing multiple groups statistically
Understand when and how to apply ANOVA
How to interpret an ANOVA test
Test results
Test statistic
How to reject the null hypothesis, and that this means there is just a group difference, but can’t tell which groups are different
The idea of post-hoc analysis and how this relates to the concept of power

Comparing frequencies (chi-square)
Students will understand 
the value of testing frequencies statistically for both goodness of fit and tests of independence
Understand when and how to apply chi-squared tests
How to interpret a chi-square test
Test results
Test statistic
How to reject the null hypothesis

Correlations
Students will understand 
the value of testing two continuous variables statistically
the difference between correlation and causation
when and how to apply a Pearson correlation test
How to interpret an r-value
Test results
Test statistic
How to reject the null hypothesis

Statistics in the real world
Sample size and power
Non-parametric tests
Effect size
Messiness and cleaning
Analysis is fast, prep and collection are the long game
