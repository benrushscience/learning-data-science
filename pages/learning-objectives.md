# Learning objectives outline

This document serves to show the learning objectives of all topics this websites pages.

### 1. Introduction
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to: <br>
* Identify why statistics is helpful in the real world for assessing differences and patterns
* Describe the challenges of determining differences and patterns
* Discuss a comparison model of genetic diversity (dogs) for reference when thinking through the following lessons


### 2. Genetic diversity
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to: <br>
* Restate what genes and DNA are with analogies to cooking
* Define genetic diversity, genetic variation, and gene expression
* Review core concepts in plants and animal genetic diversity


### 3. Averages and medians (measures of centrality)
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to: <br>
* Calculate the mean and median
* Illustrate why the mean and median is useful when critically thinking about data
* Describe and recognize how the median and mean can be skewed 


### 4. Variance and distributions
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to: <br>
* Restate how the mean is helpful but is aided by variance to critically think about data distribution and skew
* Calculate and describe what standard deviation is for a sample
* Explain what distributions are and why the normal distribution is used frequently


### 5. Probability and z-score
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to: <br>
* Discuss the basics of events happening in terms of probability
* Describe how z-scores of a individual data point explain how common that data point is
* Interpret how z-scores interact with distributions and how we obtain p-values from distribution and tables


### 6. Hypothesis testing
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to: <br>
* Describe and recognize a scientific hypothesis
* Describe and form null and alternative hypotheses
* Discuss how it’s impossible to know everything about all variables in space and time, so we reject the null hypothesis


### 7. Comparing 2 groups (t-tests)
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to: <br>
* Demonstratethe value of testing two groups statistically
* Explain when and how to apply t-tests
* Demonstrate how to and critique an interpretation of a t-test including:
  1.  _Test results_
  2. _T statistic_
  3. _How to reject the null hypothesis and its meaning_


### 8. Comparing 2+ groups (ANOVA)
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to: <br>
* Discuss the value of testing multiple groups statistically
* Explain when and how to apply ANOVA
* Demonstrate how to and critique an interpretation of an ANOVA test including:
  1.  _Test results_
  2. _F statistic_
  3. _How to reject the null hypothesis, and that this means there is a global group difference, but can’t tell which groups are different_
* Define a post-hoc analysis and explain how a post-hoc analysis yields additional results about multiple group comparisons


### 9. Comparing frequencies (Chi-square)
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to: <br>
* Discuss the value of testing frequencies statistically for both goodness of fit and tests of independence
* Explain when and how to apply chi-squared tests
* Demonstrate how to and critique an interpretation of Chi-Square test including:
  1. _Test results_
  2. _Chi-square statistic_
  3. _How to reject the null hypothesis, and that this means there is a global group difference, but can’t tell which groups are different_


### 10. Correlations
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to: <br>
* Discuss the value of testing two continuous variables statistically
* Explain the difference between correlation and causation
* Demonstrate how to and critique an interpretation of Pearson correlation and multiple regression test including:
  1. _How to interpret an r-value_
  2. _How to interpret the results of a multiple regression test_
  3. _How to reject the null hypothesis and understand that rejecting the null hypothesis for a correlational test still means no causation_


### 11. Statistics in the real world
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to: <br>
* Discuss sample size and power
* Identify when to use and the value of non-parametric tests
* Describe effect size and why it is important in statistics
* Underlines the importance and lengthy process of data cleaning
* Illustrate real world applications of statistics that have been used to improve the world
