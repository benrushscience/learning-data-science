# Learning objectives outline

This document serves to show the learning objectives of all topics this websites pages.

### 1. Introduction
By the end of this lesson, students will know: <br>
* Reasons why statistics is helpful in the real world for identifying differences and patterns
* Challenges of trying to determine differences and patterns
* A comparison model of genetic diversity (dogs) to reference when thinking through the following lessons

### 2. Genetic diversity
By the end of this lesson, students will know: <br>
* What genes and DNA are
* How to define genetic diversity, genetic variation, and gene expression
* How genetic diversity applies to Fast Plants

### 3. Averages and medians (measures of centrality)
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to calculate the mean and median
* Explain why the mean and median is useful when critically thinking about data
* Explain how the median and mean can be skewed 

### 4. Variance and distributions
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to: <br>
* Explain how the mean is helpful but is aided by variance to critically think about data
* Explain what standard deviation is for a sample
* Understand what distributions are and why the normal distribution is used frequently

### 5. Probability and z-score
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to understand: <br>
* the basics of events happening in terms of probability
* How z-scores of a individual data point explain how common that data point is
* How z-scores interact with distributions and we get p-values from it

### 6. Hypothesis testing
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to understand: <br>
* What a hypothesis is
* What is a null and alternative hypothesis
* How it’s impossible to know everything about all variables in space and time, so we reject the null hypothesis
* when to reject the null hypothesis based on p-values

### 7. Comparing 2 groups (t-tests)
Students will understand : <br>
* the value of testing two groups statistically
* Understand when and how to apply t-tests
* How to interpret a t-test
* Test results
* Test statistic
* How to reject the null hypothesis

### 8. Comparing 2+ groups (ANOVA)
Students will understand : <br>
* the value of testing multiple groups statistically
* Understand when and how to apply ANOVA
* How to interpret an ANOVA test
* Test results
* Test statistic
* How to reject the null hypothesis, and that this means there is just a group difference, but can’t tell which groups are different
* The idea of post-hoc analysis

### 9. Comparing frequencies (chi-square)
Students will understand : <br>
* the value of testing frequencies statistically for both goodness of fit and tests of independence
* Understand when and how to apply chi-squared tests
* How to interpret a chi-square test
* Test results
* Test statistic
* How to reject the null hypothesis

### 10. Correlations
Students will understand: <br>
* the value of testing two continuous variables statistically
* the difference between correlation and causation
* when and how to apply a Pearson correlation test
* How to interpret an r-value
* Test results
* Test statistic
* How to reject the null hypothesis

### 11. Statistics in the real world
Students will understand: <br>
* Sample size and power
* Non-parametric tests
* Effect size
* Messiness and cleaning
* Analysis is fast, prep and collection are the long game
