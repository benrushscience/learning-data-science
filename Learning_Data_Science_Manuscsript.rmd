# JOSE papers should include:

-List all authors and affiliations.
# Maybe Heidi in here too?
-Describe the submission, and explain its eligibility for JOSE.
-Include a “Statement of Need” section, explaining how the submitted artifacts contribute to computationally 
  enabled teaching and learning, and describing how they might be adopted by others.
-For software submissions, describe the functionality of the software, usage and recent experience of use
 in teaching and learning situations.
-For learning modules, describe the learning objectives, content, instructional design, and experience of 
  use in teaching and learning situations.
-Tell us the “story” of the project: how did it come to be?
-Cite key references, including a link to the open archive of the sofware or the learning module.
-JOSE welcomes submissions with diverse educational contexts. You should write your paper for a non-specialist reader. 
  Your submission should probably be around 1000 words (or around two pages).
- Create bibliography
- Name of software product (maybe PonderStats... ponderstats.wid.wisc.edu)

# Summary
We created a website for containing intrductory statistics learning materials accompanied by engaging media and R scripts that students can use. 
The website and scripts are designed to mirror an introductory course to statistics and tie it to serveral realworld
examples, like genetic diversity. The website, which is hosted on GitHub pages, starts with an introduction that
middle school, high school, and undergraduate students can grasp- the diversity of dog breeds. We introduce the 
character of Rhonda, a tall female golden retriever. We lead readers through the thinking "how do we actually know Rhonda
is tall?". We lead readers through comparisons of Rhonda to other golden retreivers based on personal observations, defining
a metric of "tallness", ie height, comparing Rhonda to other golden retreivers (z-score introduction), and eventually other 
bog breeds (for t-tests, ANOVAs, correlations, and beyond). We lead the readers through these concepts all while providing
humorous examples and comments, links for further learning, RShiny Apps for readers to learn experientially, visuals, embedded 
videos, and the scripts for students to follow along. In total, readers have access to 11 different lessons to learn about 
introductory statistics and data science at their own pace.

# Statement of Need
In our experience, the introduction to statistics and data science rely heavily on the mathematical
formulas instead of the versatile and useful applications of these formulas. In fact, one of the authors 
struggled in calculus because the applications to the realworld seemed extremely distant. He stopped taking
math classes until forced to take statistics to complete his undergraduate degree. Despite his hesitation,
he fell in love with statistics and absorbed all of the information possible. The authors hope that 
this website might be able to connect with and inspire younger learners to pursue the applied mathematics
fields of statistics and data science. The website and open scripts are aimed to be fun, engaging, and a mix 
of media that focus on why these fields are important for individual decision making and how they can be 
potential career paths as well. The option to delve further into the formulas in statics are available, but the
interpretations of statistical tests to realworld applications are prioritized. Rshiny apps and the code that
generated many of the figures are available for students to interact with. We believe this website and script can
serve to provide an intriguing first encounter with statistics and data scientists, especially for those students
who might be conditioned to be math averse.

# Website description
The website provides an introduction to statistics and data science for middle school, high school, and undergraduate students. 
The writing and multiple media are designed to be engaging and fun while still covering the topics of an introductory statistics
course. The website is focused much more on the reasoning behind the statistics and data science than the mathematical formulas.
The website is hosted on GitHub pages and can be found at ponderstats.wid.wisc.edu. The website is divided into 11 lessons, which
can be navigated to from the home page. The lessons are as follows:

| Lesson Name | Topic |
|:---------|:---------|
| I've never seen a dog before    | Why data science?    |
| In a world of possibilities   | Genetic diversity     |
| Finding average ground | Averages and medians |
| Seeing (data) is believing (data) | Variance and distributions |
| Catching Z's | Probabilities and z-scores |
| I love being rejected | Hypothesis testing |
| Things might be different now | Comparing two groups (t-tests) |
| More things might be different now | Comparing more than two groups (ANOVA) |
| χ<sup>2</sup> marks the spot | Comparing frequencies (χ<sup>2</sup> tests) |
| What goes up must go down, or up, or nowhere | Correlations |
| With great power comes maybe good effect size | Statistics in the real world |

feedback from instructors and teachers?






############################## Example paper ################################33

The forces on stars, galaxies, and dark matter under external gravitational
fields lead to the dynamical evolution of structures in the universe. The orbits
of these bodies are therefore key to understanding the formation, history, and
future state of galaxies. The field of "galactic dynamics," which aims to model
the gravitating components of galaxies to study their structure and evolution,
is now well-established, commonly taught, and frequently used in astronomy.
Aside from toy problems and demonstrations, the majority of problems require
efficient numerical tools, many of which require the same base code (e.g., for
performing numerical orbit integration).

``Gala`` is an Astropy-affiliated Python package for galactic dynamics. Python
enables wrapping low-level languages (e.g., C) for speed without losing
flexibility or ease-of-use in the user-interface. The API for ``Gala`` was
designed to provide a class-based and user-friendly interface to fast (C or
Cython-optimized) implementations of common operations such as gravitational
potential and force evaluation, orbit integration, dynamical transformations,
and chaos indicators for nonlinear dynamics. ``Gala`` also relies heavily on and
interfaces well with the implementations of physical units and astronomical
coordinate systems in the ``Astropy`` package [@astropy] (``astropy.units`` and
``astropy.coordinates``).

``Gala`` was designed to be used by both astronomical researchers and by
students in courses on gravitational dynamics or astronomy. It has already been
used in a number of scientific publications [@Pearson:2017] and has also been
used in graduate courses on Galactic dynamics to, e.g., provide interactive
visualizations of textbook material [@Binney:2008]. The combination of speed,
design, and support for Astropy functionality in ``Gala`` will enable exciting
scientific explorations of forthcoming data releases from the *Gaia* mission
[@gaia] by students and experts alike.

# Mathematics

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$


# Citations

Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
format.

For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)"
