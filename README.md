# An introduction to data science

## How to use this website

This website
- is intended for middle and high school students learning to apply statistics for the first time
- covers the basic statistical concepts and tests that are covered in an introductory statistics course
- was developed to accompany the learning materials of [Wisconsin Fast Plants](https://fastplants.org), but the knowledge can be applied for any statistics introductory course
- has code you can follow with [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) to generate similar figures & graphs as the website. Find the code [here](https://github.com/benrushscience/learning-data-science/blob/main/code/fast_plants_datawebsite_script.R). 

Each lesson 
- covers a basic overview of concepts and aims to provide the theoretical take aways without being bogged down by the math,
- has resources for students to learn more about the math behind each concept, but the main purpose of the website is to teach how to think about statistics.
