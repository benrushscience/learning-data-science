| Topic | Key take-away points | Webpage |
| :---:   | :---: | :---:       |
| 1. Why data science? | The field of statistics is helpful for determing patterns versus random chance | [page](https://benrushscience.github.io/learning-data-science//pages/1-introduction.html) | 
| 2. Genetic Diversity | DNA and its expression causes the wide variety among living things and physical traits we see in the world |  [page](https://benrushscience.github.io/learning-data-science//pages/2-genetic-diversity.html) | 
| 3. Averages and medians | Averages, or means, and medians are a fundamental metric to inform us about continuous variables in our data |  [page](https://benrushscience.github.io/learning-data-science//pages/3-averages-and-medians.html) |
| 4. Variance and distributions | The spread of data is also valuable to determine if the spread is normal or skewed. Histograms are very helpful for us to visualize this |  [page](https://benrushscience.github.io/learning-data-science/pages/4-variance-and-distributions.html) |
| 5. Probability and z-scores | We can use probability and a standardized score of probabilty, z-scores, to inform us how rare and observation is  |  [page](https://benrushscience.github.io/learning-data-science/pages/5-probability-and-z-scores.html) |
| 6. Hypothesis testing | We generate ideas about patterns in the world, called hypothesis, that we test via statistics for build evidence for our idea |  [page](https://benrushscience.github.io/learning-data-science/pages/6-hypothesis-testing.html) |
| 7. Comparing 2 groups (t-tests) | We can compare if two groups are different using a statistical test called a t-test |  [page](https://benrushscience.github.io/learning-data-science/pages/7-comparing-2-groups.html) |
| 8. Comparing 2+ groups (ANOVA) | We can compare if two or more groups are different using a statistical test called an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test |  [page](https://benrushscience.github.io/learning-data-science/pages/8-comparing-2+-groups.html) |
| 9. Comparing frequencies (chi-square) | We can compare if groups differ in frequency of observations or groups differ in a categorical variable (hair color) via a Chi-Square test |  [page](https://benrushscience.github.io/learning-data-science/pages/9-comparing-frequencies.html) |
| 10. Correlations | We can determine how much two continuous variables are related based on their correlation strength and the formula of how they relate with a regression equation |  [page](https://benrushscience.github.io/learning-data-science/pages/10-correlations.html) |
| 11. Statistics in the real world | Data analysis is fast. Data cleaning can be lengthy and tricky with factors like power, effect size, and normality to consider |  [page](https://benrushscience.github.io/learning-data-science/pages/11-statistics-in-the-real-world.html) |
