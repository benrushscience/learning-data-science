| Topic | Key take-away points | Lecture notes |
| :---:   | :---: | :---:       |
| 1. Introduction to data science | i) When it comes to probabilities, we do not trust our gut, we trust the formulas; <br> <br>  ii) We estimate population probabilities from observed frequencies in samples; <br> <br> iii) The chosen sample is very important | [notes](/pages/introduction.md) | 
| 2. Genetic Diversity | i) Product rule: we can calculate the probability of simultaneous events when they are independent; <br> <br> ii) Addition rule: we can calculate the probability of different disjoint events  |  [notes](https://benrushscience.github.io/learning-data-science/pages/genetic-diversity.html) | 
| 3. Averages and medians | i) The conditional probability allows us to update a probability with new information; <br> <br> ii) Very important not to confuse the conditioning event as probabilities would change  |  [notes](https://benrushscience.github.io/learning-data-science/pages/averages-and-median.md) |
| 4. Variance and distributions | i)   |  [change](https://benrushscience.github.io/learning-data-science/pages/variance-and-distributions.md) |
| 5. Probability and z-scores | i)   |  [notes](https://crsl4.github.io/forensic-stat//lecture-notes/3updating-probs.html) |
| 6. Hypothesis testing | i)   |  [notes](https://crsl4.github.io/forensic-stat//lecture-notes/3updating-probs.html) |
| 7. Comparing 2 groups (t-tests) | i)   |  [notes](https://crsl4.github.io/forensic-stat//lecture-notes/3updating-probs.html) |
| 8. Comparing 2+ groups (ANOVA) | i)   |  [notes](https://crsl4.github.io/forensic-stat//lecture-notes/3updating-probs.html) |
| 9. Comparing frequencies (chi-square) | i)   |  [notes](https://crsl4.github.io/forensic-stat//lecture-notes/3updating-probs.html) |
| 10. Correlations | i)   |  [notes](https://crsl4.github.io/forensic-stat//lecture-notes/3updating-probs.html) |
